Users will need to sign-up with the app to be able to retrieve public tweets from known Twitter handles. Authentication is handled via Devise.
The app is setup with a Twitter client as a service that uses Grackle gem to connect to Twitter with OAuth and retrieve tweets.
Tweets are construed as a resource with the model defining a cache policy that helps prevent API rate limiting
Tweets Controller delegates call to the Twitter client service and is responsible for minifying the response made available to the view.
